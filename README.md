# Randomizer
![Preview](screenshot.png "preview")

## About
iPhone app with better random number picker (not on AppStore yet.)<br>
My first ever Swift project

## Native Design
Randomizer is written in SwiftUI and has iOS native design.

## CSV Loading
Supports loading CSV name list. Winner's name will be shown below the number.

## Future plans
I might add external monitor support later. Connected monitor will only show the number and the name.
